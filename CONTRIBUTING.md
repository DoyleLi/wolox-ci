# Contributing

To contribute: 

Clone the repo,

    git clone git@github.com:kathywar/wolox-ci.git

Create a private branch, then make your changes and push to your branch.

When you have verified your changes, submit a pull request. In the comments for your pull request, please
describe the verification testing you've done. Your verification job should include
regression tests - I suggest running your test yaml file with both windows and linux hosts, and both
parallel and serial tasks, for example.
